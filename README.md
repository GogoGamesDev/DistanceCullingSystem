# DistanceCullingSystem

A distance-based culling system inspired by similar techniques used in classic titles like Silent Hill on the PSX.
The culling distance is fully customizable.

You can exclude specific objects from being affected.

Works best when combined with fog to "hide" object pop-in/pop-out.
In high-polygon environments, it can improve framerate by 10â€“15%.
